        <li> Add salt and sugar, mix and close the lid. </li>
        <li> Cook over high heat until the whistle blows, then lower the whistle and cook over medium heat for 30 minutes. </li>
        <li> Cooking time may vary depending on the freshness of the beans. </li>
        <li> After 30 minutes, it is useful to check. If it is not cooked, you can boil it again a little more. </li>
        <li> I use the beans without boiling them, this way they are much more vitaminized and taste better. </li>
