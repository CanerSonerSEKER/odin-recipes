1) In my project I will use HTML to design a website with a restaurant menu and its contents. I will practice all the HTML commands I have learned at a basic level in this project. I will then update the website with new information I learn. 
2)These skills will include creating headings, paragraphs, linking within paragraphs, adding images and similar HTML commands.
3)I think it will be fun. Let's have fun.
